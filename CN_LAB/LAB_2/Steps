STEP 1: Create a Topology
STEP 2: configure the IP addresses
STEP 3: configure AA server
STEP 4: Eable AA service on router
>AAA new-model command activates the AAA functionality on cisco router, without this the AAA command will not work, 
   here the router switches from simle authentication to centralized AAA control
STEP 5: Configure the router to use AAA router.

this command tells the router where the AAA server is located adn specifies the shared secret key for secure communication 
STEP 6: configure the authentication method
"aaa authentication login default group radius local"
>When a user login the router checks AAA sever first for user authenication if it is not available in AAA server 
  it will check the local database
STEP 7: configure local backup user
> This step is creating the backup and will be used when the AAA server fails.
STEP 8: Set domain name 
> SSH confuguration
STEP 9:Ensure the host name is set
STEP 10: Generate RSA key
STEP 11: Enable SSH version 2
STEP 12: configure vty line for SSH communications
